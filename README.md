# KMP search algorithm

The Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm is a useful search algorithmn that finds substrings of text within body of text (or string)
The algorithm works by efficiently iterating through a given text. The algorithm uses the properties of the "Longest Prefix Suffix"
To accurately calculate the minimal index positioning at all times as it traverses the text_str.
